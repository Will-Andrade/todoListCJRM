## 📚 Project

I made this project during the CJRM - Curso de JavaScript Roger Melo course, to practice DOM interactions, array methods (map, filter), and much more.

## ✍️ What I've Learned

1. How to use data- attributes with HTML and JavaScript to interact with the DOM.
2. Deep understanding of .map() and .filter() array methods.
3. Better refactoring and variables/functions naming.
